# Lineage Lit 📚

> *A Goodreads alternative focused on creator lineage and influences.*

**The Problem:** Goodreads is old, clunky, and reader-centric. Everyone uses it, but nobody loves it.

**The Vision:** Track books, articles, and screenplays through the **creator's lens**. Where did writers learn their craft? What influenced their work?

**The Magic:** Discover the lineage of ideas - trace influences from Hemingway to hip-hop, from ancient poets to modern screenwriters.

## Core Concepts

### 🧬 Creator Lineage
- Every work has influences
- Every writer has teachers (literal and inspirational)
- Every story exists in a web of creative DNA

### 🎯 Smart Recommendations
Not "people who liked X also liked Y" but:
- "This writer was influenced by the same Japanese poets as your favorite author"
- "This screenplay carries the same narrative DNA as the novel you loved"
- "These works share thematic lineage"

### 🧠 Brain Mapping
"What parts of your brain are getting lit up?"
- Track which influences resonate with you
- Discover patterns in your own creative lineage
- Map your intellectual DNA

## Tech Stack (Initial Thoughts)

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) or Node.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Neo4j (for graph relationships)
- **Data Source:** Initial manual curation, later scraping/public APIs

## MVP Features

1. [ ] Basic book/work database
2. [ ] Creator profiles with influence tracking
3. [ ] Lineage visualization (graph view)
4. [ ] Recommendation engine based on influence overlap
5. [ ] User reading tracking
6. [ ] Mobile-responsive design

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Prototype
- [ ] Design mockups
- [ ] Basic data model
- [ ] Simple web interface
- [ ] 50 curated works with lineage data

### Phase 2: MVP
- [ ] User accounts
- [ ] Search and discovery
- [ ] Graph visualization
- [ ] Recommendation engine v1

### Phase 3: Scale
- [ ] Mobile app
- [ ] Data import (Goodreads, LibraryThing)
- [ ] Community contributions
- [ ] API for researchers

## Inspiration

- **Goodreads:** The incumbent, but dated
- **Wikipedia:** "Influenced by" sections
- **Literary criticism:** Academic tracing of influences
- **Spotify Wrapped:** "Your year in reading" but with lineage

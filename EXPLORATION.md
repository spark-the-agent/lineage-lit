## Sitcom Teleplay Lineage

**What it is:** Tracing the DNA of TV comedy writing

**Fun angle:** Who influenced your favorite sitcom?
- **I Love Lucy** → **Mary Tyler Moore** → **Seinfeld** → **The Office**
- **Taxi** → **Cheers** → **Frasier** → **Modern Family**
- **The Simpsons** → **Family Guy** → **Rick & Morty**

**Data sources:**
- Writers Guild databases
- Episode credits
- Writer interviews (Writer's Guild Magazine, etc.)
- Showrunner oral histories

**Example exploration:**
- Aaron Sorkin → West Wing → Newsroom → The Social Network
- Did Sorkin influence anyone else? Who influenced Sorkin?
- Paddy Chayefsky → Network → Sorkin's dialogue style?

**Revenue hook:** "Who wrote your favorite episode? Trace their career!"

## Creative Lineage Challenges

Gamify the data collection:
- "Map the entire Beat Generation in 7 days"
- "Connect Shakespeare to Lin-Manuel Miranda" (longest chain wins)
- "Find the missing link: Who influenced Cormac McCarthy?"

**Reward:** Badges, reputation scores, early access to features

## Beautiful Visualizations

Not just graphs - make it art:
- **Constellation maps:** Each creator is a star, influences are lines
- **River flows:** Time flows down, tributaries are influences
- **Family trees:** Like ancestry.com but for creativity
- **Timeline views:** See influences by decade

**Example:**
1920s: Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Stein (Paris)
→ 1940s: Kerouac (reads Hemingway)
→ 1950s: Beat Generation
→ 1970s: Hunter S. Thompson (Gonzo)

## Next Steps (Low Pressure)

### This Week: Exploration Mode
1. **Pick ONE classic** from Gutenberg (suggestion: The Great Gatsby)
2. **Research its lineage** (Fitzgerald influenced by? Who did Fitzgerald influence?)
3. **Create a beautiful visualization** for just that one book
4. **Share it** - "The Creative DNA of Gatsby"

### Next Week: Expand
1. Pick a movement (Lost Generation, easy starting point)
2. Map 5-10 creators with solid relationships
3. Build the interactive graph

### Later: Sitcoms
1. Pick one show (suggestion: The Office)
2. Trace: Writers → Previous shows → Mentors
3. Find connections to classic sitcoms

## Keep It Fun Principles

- **No deadlines** - explore at leisure
- **No minimums** - one beautiful visualization beats 100 rushed ones
- **Follow curiosity** - if Hemingway leads to fishing, that's fine
- **Share discoveries** - tweet interesting lineage finds
- **Make it pretty** - beautiful charts get shared
